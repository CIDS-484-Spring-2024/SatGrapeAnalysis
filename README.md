# Understanding grape production via satellites

## Goals 
This research project aims to leverage satellite technology for an exploration of grape vegetation dynamics, with a focus on understanding the factors influencing optimal grape production. The study involves satellite-based observations and analysis to discover insights into vineyard health, growth patterns, and key determinants of grape yields.

## Update (2/4/2024)
I am working with Professor Susanne Wiesner from the Earth Science department on this research project. Currently, I am refining the research topic, discussing the primary objectives, requirements, and determining the appropriate satellites and tools for the study.
