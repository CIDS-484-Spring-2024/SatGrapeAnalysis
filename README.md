# Analysis of Grapevine Growth Using Satellite

## Goals 
This research project aims to leverage satellite technology for an exploration of grape vegetation dynamics, with a focus on understanding the factors influencing optimal grape production. The study involves satellite-based observations and analysis to discover insights into vineyard health, growth patterns, and key determinants of grape yields.

## Resources & Methods
### Exploratory Question and Methods
* Where grapes grow(area of interest): https://croplandcros.scinet.usda.gov/
* Methods
Exploratory Question:
・What is the relationship between the four variables and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)?​
 -  Correlation Coefficient​
 - Multiple Regression Analysis​
Hypotheses:​
・Hypothesis 1: There exists a positive relation between precipitation levels and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), suggesting that increased precipitation is associated with higher NDVI values, indicating healthier vegetation.​
- Linear Regression Analysis​
Hypothesis 2: A positive correlation is anticipated between NDVI values and the yield, suggesting that  higher NDVI value are associated with higher yield.​
- Linear Regression Analysis​

## Update (3/31/2024)
I am working with Professor Susanne Wiesner from the Earth Science department at UWRF and Dr. Steven Shultz from University of South Alabama on this research project. 
Currently, I am conducting statistical analysis based on the model I have created. For more info, please look at my slide and presentation.
